I made VueSuggest to learn [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/).

VueSuggest is a small but useful tool to get suggestions from Google for a keyword. These suggestions can then be copied into Google's Keyword Planner to get estimates on monthly search volume. Furthermore, the suggestions are a perfect way to start a blog article for a topic, because it helps you to write about stuff people are actually searching for.
